# Product Context: FSKit

## Problem Statement

Modern web application development involves numerous technical decisions, setup steps, and integration challenges that can significantly slow down initial development. Developers often spend days or weeks setting up project infrastructure before they can begin building core business features.

## Key Challenges Addressed

1. **Technology Fragmentation**: The JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem offers many choices for each layer of the stack, requiring careful selection and integration.
2. **Type Safety Gaps**: Maintaining type safety across the full stack (database, API, frontend) is complex but essential for reliability.
3. **Boilerplate Repetition**: Standard elements like authentication, data validation, and API client setup are reimplemented across projects.
4. **Performance Configuration**: Optimizing for modern web standards requires specific configurations and optimizations.
5. **International Support**: Adding multilingual support is often an afterthought, making it harder to implement later.

## Solution

FSKit provides a pre-configured, production-ready foundation that addresses these challenges by:

- Integrating best-in-class libraries with sensible defaults
- Establishing patterns for type-safe data flow from database to UI
- Providing ready-to-use authentication, form handling, and API infrastructure
- Configuring SEO, performance, and internationalization from the start
- Setting up development tooling for code quality and collaboration

## Target Users

- Full-stack developers building web applications
- Development teams looking to standardize their tech stack
- Startups aiming to accelerate initial development
- Developers who value type safety and modern best practices

## Success Metrics

- Reduced time to initial productive development
- Improved developer experience with integrated tooling
- Higher code quality through enforced standards
- Adaptability to various business domain requirements
- Maintainability during long-term project evolution
