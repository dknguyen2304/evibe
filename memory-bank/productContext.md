# Product Context

## Purpose

FSKit is a starter kit and development framework for full-stack web applications, designed to establish industry-standard patterns and practices. It serves as a foundation for building scalable, maintainable applications with an emphasis on developer experience and code quality.

## Problem Statement

Web development involves numerous complex decisions about architecture, tooling, and patterns. Teams often struggle with:

1. **Inconsistent architecture** across projects
2. **Configuration overhead** for tooling and best practices
3. **Type safety issues** between frontend and backend
4. **Authentication complexity** and security concerns
5. **Performance optimization** without sacrificing developer experience

FSKit aims to solve these problems by providing a pre-configured, opinionated framework that incorporates best practices, modern tooling, and proven patterns.

## Target Audience

FSKit is designed for:

- **Professional developers** seeking a robust starting point for web applications
- **Development teams** aiming for consistency across projects
- **Technical leads** who want to establish scalable patterns
- **Solo developers** who need a complete stack without reinventing the wheel

## Key Differentiators

What sets FSKit apart from other solutions:

1. **Full-stack TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety with no compromises
2. **Next.js App Router** with integrated API Routes: Unified application structure
3. **TypeORM integration**: Type-safe database access with proper entity relationships
4. **Authentication patterns**: JWT implementation with secure practices
5. **Internationalization built-in**: Multi-language support from day one
6. **Developer experience focus**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and more pre-configured

## Technical Vision

FSKit establishes a foundation for web applications with:

- **Type safety** across all boundaries (client/server/database)
- **Performance optimization** with server components and edge runtime
- **Security best practices** for authentication and data handling
- **Scalable architecture** using feature-based organization
- **Testing practices** baked into the framework
- **Documentation standards** for maintainable code

## Future Direction

FSKit will evolve in the following areas:

1. **Enhanced authentication** with refresh tokens and OAuth providers
2. **More robust testing patterns** for components and API routes
3. **Additional database options** beyond TypeORM
4. **CI/CD integration** with GitHub Actions
5. **Documentation generator** for API endpoints
6. **UI component library** integration options
7. **Performance monitoring** tools and practices
