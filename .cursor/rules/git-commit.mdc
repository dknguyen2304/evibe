# Git Commit Message Rules

**Description**: Enforce Conventional Commits format and set a maximum body line length of 100 characters.

## Rules

1. **Header**:
   - Must include a type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`)
   - Scope is optional and should be enclosed in parentheses, e.g., `feat(auth):`, `fix(api):`
   - Subject must be concise, written in imperative mood, and must not end with a period
   - Breaking changes must be indicated with `!` before the colon, e.g., `feat(api)!: change authentication flow`

2. **Body**:
   - Provide a detailed explanation of the changes
   - Each line in the body must not exceed 100 characters
   - Use imperative mood and explain *what* and *why* the change was made, not *how*
   - Separate body from header with a blank line

3. **Footer**:
   - Include references to issues or breaking changes if applicable
   - Breaking changes must start with `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by a description
   - Issue references should use GitHub keywords: `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`
