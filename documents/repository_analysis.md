- **API**: Next.js Route Handlers for type-safe API routes
- **Database**: TypeORM with entity models
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system
- **Form Validation**: Zod schemas with React Hook Form
- **State Management**: Zustand stores
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack React Query
- **Internationalization**: next-i18next for multi-language support
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, commitlint
- **SEO**: Meta tags, JSON-LD, Open Graph, sitemap.xml, robots.txt

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a well-organized structure:

```

## Key Features

### Authentication System

- JWT-based authentication
- User registration and login
- Password hashing and security

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- User, Role, and Permission entities
- Many-to-many relationship between users and roles
- API protection based on roles and permissions

### Database Structure

- TypeORM entities for data modeling
- User entity with roles relationship
- Role entity with permissions relationship
- Permission entity for granular access control

### API Routes

- Authentication endpoints
- User management endpoints
- Protected routes with RBAC
- Admin-specific endpoints

## Relevance to Project Requirements

The FSKit repository provides several components that align with our project requirements:

1. **Authentication and RBAC**: The existing authentication system and role-based access control can be used to implement the required client, admin management, and role-based access control.

2. **Next.js App Router**: The modern Next.js structure provides a solid foundation for building the movie streaming platform with client and admin interfaces.

3. **TypeORM Database Integration**: The database structure can be extended to include movie-related entities while maintaining the existing user and role management.

4. **API Structure**: The existing API routes can be extended to include movie-related endpoints while maintaining the authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Limitations and Gaps

While FSKit provides a solid foundation, there are several gaps that need to be addressed:

1. **Movie-Related Entities**: Need to create new entities for movies, categories, actors, etc.

2. **Redis Integration**: Need to implement Redis for performance optimization as specified in the requirements.

3. **Media Handling**: Need to implement functionality for handling movie files, thumbnails, and streaming.

4. **Search Functionality**: Need to implement search functionality similar to the target website.

## Conclusion

The FSKit repository provides an excellent starting point for our project with its authentication, user management, and role-based access control features. We can leverage these existing components while extending the system to include movie-related functionality and Redis optimization to meet all the project requirements.
